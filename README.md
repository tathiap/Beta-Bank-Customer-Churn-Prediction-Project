# Beta Bank Customer Churn

The Beta Bank Customer Churn Prediction project addresses the critical need for proactive customer retention in the banking sector. 
With a focus on leveraging machine learning, the project aims to construct a robust predictive model by analyzing rich customer data. 
The dataset, encompassing diverse features such as demographics, transaction history, and engagement patterns, serves as the foundation for the model.

The primary objective is to achieve the highest possible F1 score, a metric balancing precision and recall. 
The project establishes a minimum success threshold of an F1 score of 0.59. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using the AUC-ROC metric, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its ability to discern potential churn.

This initiative aligns with Beta Bank's strategic goals by providing insights into customer behavior and facilitating early identification of potential churn. 
The dual-metric evaluation enhances the project's effectiveness in supporting Beta Bank's proactive customer retention initiatives, emphasizing a nuanced assessment of the predictive model's efficacy in addressing customer attrition.
